# Financial Transparency Statement

Dear Keyboardminder Community,

I wanted to take a moment to provide transparency regarding the financial aspects of Keyboardminder. My goal is to foster an open and honest dialogue about the project's sustainability.

### Project Purpose and Goals:
Keyboardminder was created to provide a set of tools to limit mouse usage and help learn keyboard shortcuts. This project is the first of many I am developing with the broader goal of having a workflow you can use to get your necessary work done as efficiently as possible. My aim is to work towards a future where computers are better tools for all of us. Iâ€™m committed to ensuring the long-term success and growth of the project. Importantly, Keyboardminder is the first in a series of projects that build on top of each other, creating a cohesive ecosystem.

### Code Development Background:
While the code itself is fairly simple, it took a long time experimenting to come up with the ideas for it and fine tuning them. 
I am commited to delivering a unique and effective solution.
Future projects will grow in complexity and will be written in C++ or C#. All of them are already part way done. I hope that you can find some value in these projects and they can help improve your workflow.

### Financial Considerations:
Maintaining and improving Keyboardminder requires time and resources.
As the project lead, I am committed to investing my time and effort to ensure its success.
In the spirit of transparency, I would like to share that I work on these projects in my free time and I need to generate enough funds to justify continue working on them. By donating you allow me to continue my work on these projects and give back to the open source community.

### Funding Model:
To support ongoing development, I am using GitHub Sponsors. Any financial contributions received will not only sustain Keyboardminder but will also lay the foundation for a series of interconnected projects. Your support will directly contribute to stability, and improved features.

### Community Involvement:
Community engagement is crucial for the success of Keyboardminder. Funds, if any, will also be directed towards documentation and support to enhance the overall experience for everyone involved.

### Future Funding Considerations:
If successfully funded through this open-source model, Keyboardminder will pave the way for the subsequent projects in the series, all of which will continue to be released under open source licenses. However, it's crucial to note that if funding is not successfully secured, alternative funding models may be necessary. It may impact the feasibility of releasing future projects as open source.  I am committed to exploring all avenues to maintain the open nature of my work, but your support in this initial phase is especially vital to establishing a sustainable open-source ecosystem.

### Budget Transparency:
I am committed to providing regular updates on how funds are allocated. Your support will enable the growth of not only Keyboardminder but also the entire series of projects in the vision.  

Thank you for your continued support and commitment to the success of Keyboardminder and related projects. I believe that transparency is key to building a strong and trusting community, and I welcome your feedback on this statement.

Best regards,\
Andrew
